# To Do
- [x] Check input file's properties to avoid squeezing them if they're already smaller than the output file properties.
- [x] Test other codecs:
  - [x] libaom-av1 (AV1): verrrrrry slow (0.01x)
  - [x] libvpx-vp9 (VP9): slow (0.36x)
- [x] Show single progress bar line instead of multiline output?
- [ ] See if snap size can be further reduced.
- [ ] Consider GUI
